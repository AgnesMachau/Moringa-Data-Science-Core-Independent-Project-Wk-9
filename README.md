# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction 
### The Titanium Project

The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. Using different statistical techniques and machine learning, we want to get as much information as possible from the data and formulate a model that will make predictions on whether a person survived the disaster or not.

###The Spam Base project

Using the spam base data, we want to use different variables provided to see if we can predict if an email is spam or not.
